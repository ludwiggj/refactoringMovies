refactoringMovies
=================

This is a worked refactoring exercise, based on the [refactoring movies example](http://www.slideshare.net/liufabin66688/refactoring-example) by Sherif Ghali.

Each significant step in the refactoring process is represented by a separate commit, and is **tagged** as follows:

* **Start**  
This commit i.e. the initial starting point of the code.  
See **README_Start.md** (in this directory) for a description of the initial state of the code in this commit, before refactoring begins.
 
* **Step01**  
The code after the first round of refactoring.  
See **README_Step01.md** for an explanation of the refactoring changes that have been made in this step, and the reasoning behind them.

* **StepN**  
See **README_StepN.md** for an explanation of the refactoring changes that have been made in this step, and the reasoning behind them.
